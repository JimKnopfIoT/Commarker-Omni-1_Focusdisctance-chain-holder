# Magnetic focus distance holder 
In a video on yt about the ComMarker Omni 1, i saw a nice distance measurement tool consisting of 2 parts, 
a chain with a defined length of the Laser focus point, mounted on a magnetic chain holder and a mount-fixture. 
I found this tool so usefull that i created my own one for the ComMarker Omni 1 (10 W). It consists of 3 parts. 
The mount piece consists of 2 3D printed parts (top and bottom part, scewed together, mounted on a pipe) and the 3D printed magnetic movable arm with a ball chain.

Requirements:

    3D printer
    Filament of your choice (i use PETG)
    2 M4 bolts and 2 square nuts (for the fixture)
    1 8x3x2 mm neodym magnet (for the fixture)
    1 Shim with 12mm diameter (for the movable arm, to stick on the magnet)
    1 Ball chain with the correct length for your focus point

I have printed two of the movable arms, one for each Lens that i use (150 mm and 300 mm lens).
I had to adjust the attachment point on the movable arm so that the lower ball of the chain touched the surface exactly.
